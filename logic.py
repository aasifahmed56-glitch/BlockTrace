# were OFAC-sanctioned in August 2022, but a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled OFAC exceeded
# its authority, and Treasury formally lifted those sanctions in March 2025. A hardcoded
# list that still flagged Tornado Cash today would itself be spreading false information.

# For any real deployment, this list must be synced from the live OFAC SDN feed
# (treasury.gov publishes a machine-readable list of crypto addresses), not hand-maintained.
